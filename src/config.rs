//! Compile-time configuration.
//!
//! The sizes of the stack's tables, queues and buffers are set at compile time.
//! They can be set in two ways:
//!
//! - With a cargo feature named `<name>-<value>`, lowercase and with dashes
//!   instead of underscores. For example `udp-socket-count-8`. Only the values
//!   listed in `Cargo.toml` can be set this way.
//! - With an environment variable named `XARXA_<NAME>` at build time. For
//!   example `XARXA_UDP_SOCKET_COUNT=8 cargo build`. They can also be set in the
//!   `[env]` section of `.cargo/config.toml`. Any value can be set this way.
//!
//! Environment variables take priority over cargo features. Enabling two cargo features
//! for the same setting with different values fails the build.
//!
//! Some data structures are statically or dynamically allocated depending on the `alloc` feature,
//! so some limits apply only with `alloc` disabled.
