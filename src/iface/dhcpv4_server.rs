//! DHCPv4 server.
//!
//! The server is part of an interface. Turn it on with
//! [`Iface::set_dhcpv4_server`] and it answers DHCP requests arriving on that
//! interface, handing out addresses from a configured pool. Inspect the leases
//! with [`Iface::dhcpv4_server_leases`] and remove one with
//! [`Iface::remove_dhcpv4_server_lease`].
//!
//! The interface must have an IPv4 address: it is the server's own address and
//! its subnet provides the subnet mask sent to clients. The pool must be inside
//! that subnet.
//!
//! Only Ethernet interfaces are supported. Requests relayed by a DHCP relay
//! agent are ignored, and offered addresses are not probed with ICMP before
//! being handed out (a client that detects a conflict declines the address,
//! which takes it out of the pool for a while).
