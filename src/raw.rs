//! Raw sockets.
//!
//! A raw socket sends and receives whole packets, headers included.
//!
//! Raw sockets can be bound in two modes, each behind its own cargo feature:
//!
//! - **Ethernet mode** (`RawMode::Ethernet`, feature `raw-ethernet`): whole Ethernet
//!   frames, optionally filtered by ethertype.
//! - **IP mode** (`RawMode::Ip`, feature `raw-ip`): whole IP packets on all
//!   interfaces. The socket may be bound to an IP version and/or an IP protocol,
//!   both optional.
