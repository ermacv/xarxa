//! UDP sockets.
//!
//! [`Stack::add_udp_socket`](crate::Stack::add_udp_socket) creates a socket inside
//! the stack and returns a [`UdpHandle`] identifying it. All operations go through
//! [`Stack::udp_socket`](crate::Stack::udp_socket), which borrows the socket as a [`UdpSocket`]:
//! receiving only touches the socket state, while sending transmits the datagram
//! immediately.
//!
//! A single [`bind`](UdpSocket::bind) call pins down (parts of) the socket's
//! 4-tuple, local and remote halves at once, each part exact or wildcard. Binding
//! to port 0 allocates an ephemeral port, and binding an identical 4-tuple to
//! another socket's is rejected.
//!
//! Received packets are queued with their IP and UDP headers still in the buffer.
//! The addresses returned in [`UdpMetadata`] are parsed back out of those header
//! bytes.
//!
//! [`UdpMetadata`] also carries the datagram's [`PacketMeta`] in both directions: on
//! receive it is what the driver attached to the packet, on send it is attached to the
//! packet handed to the driver.
